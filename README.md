Blind Attacking Framework

* version [0.1.0] --> [(public releases).(beta versions).(bugfixes patches)]

* this framework is under  AGPLv3 license 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
what is BAF ? 
* it's a framework written in python [2.7] that is being made specially for blind attacking , ie : attacking random targets with common security issues , targets are generated by the hackers search engine <a href="https://www.shodan.io/explore">"shodan"</a> and vulnerable hosts are hacked in an automated way .

* this framework is completely "neutral" ie: it's not based on shodan API and it has total dependence on web scraping , ie: the only limit on what you can do with it is your immagination as a tester & our programming skills as contributers/owners .   

how to use BAF ? 
* fire up a terminal and sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get dist-upgrade
* install [ requests , httplib , urllib , time , bs4 "BeautifulSoup" , colored , selenium , sys ] python modules 
* python BAF_0.1.0.py
* enter your shodan's account username and pass
* choose 1 , let it do it's job , press y , close the previous tab , press y ,close the previous tabs ...etc till u have the vulnerable        cams only 
* choose 2 , enter what do u want to search for (ie: NSA) , when it's done , refer to the targets text file , it will contain the targets ip:port
* that's all , till now :)
* DON'T close a loading webpage 
* beta versions will make automated browser open for better understanding ,but you can close the webcam tabs freely

how to contribute? 

the framework is under development so both testers and contributers are more than welcome to help ... so , 
* active testers and bug reporters can help us developing the TODO list of the framework & enjoy watching their TODO wishes - next to    their names - come true :) 
* contributers who provide merged <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/">pull requests</a> will be listed below and in the framework contributers section .
* contributers who provide (continuous - dramatic) <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/">merged pull requests</a> will be owners and they will have a share in the pro version profit 

how can a pull request be definitely merged?
* adds new from the TODO 
* patces bugs from the TODO
