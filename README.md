# BAF 0.1.0
Blind Attacking Framework

version [0.1.0] --> [(public releases).(beta versions).(bugfixes patches)]

this framework is under  AGPLv3 license 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
what is BAF ? 
* it's a framework written in python [2.7] that is being made specially for blind attacking , ie : attacking random targets with common security issues , targets are generated by the hackers search engine <a href="https://www.shodan.io/explore">"shodan"</a> and vulnerable hosts are hacked in an automated way .

* this framework is completely "neutral" ie: it's not based on shodan API and it has total dependence on web scraping , ie: the only limit on what you can do with it is your immagination as a tester & our programming skills as contributers/owners .   

how to use BAF ? 
* fire up a terminal and sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get dist-upgrade
* install [ requests , httplib , urllib , time , bs4 "BeautifulSoup" , selenium , sys ] python modules 
* python BAF_0.1.0.py

how to contribute? 

the framework is under development so both testers and contributers are more than welcome to help ... so , 
* active testers and bug reporters can help us developing the TODO list of the framework & enjoy watching their TODO wishes - next to    their names - come true :) 
* contributers who provide merged <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/">pull requests</a> will be listed below and in the framework contributers section .
* contributers who provide (continuous - dramatic) <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/">merged pull requests</a> will be owners and they will have a share in the pro version profit 

how can a pull request be definitely merged?
